## Yoga as a sport

#### Yoga has been recognized as a sport in India and is also recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as a sport. However, it has not yet been included in the Olympics.

In recent years, there have been efforts to include yoga in the Olympics. The International Yoga Sports Federation (IYSF) has been working towards this goal and has held several international championships. However, it is still a long process and there are several challenges to overcome before yoga can become an Olympic sport.

One of the main challenges is to establish a clear set of rules and criteria for competitive yoga, which is necessary for it to be recognized as a sport by the Olympic Committee. There are also concerns about the commercialization and standardization of yoga, which some practitioners believe goes against the principles and philosophy of yoga.

In addition, the Olympics have a limited number of sports that can be included, and the inclusion of new sports is a complex and competitive process. Other sports are also vying for a place in the Olympics, making it difficult for yoga to make the cut.

> Overall, while it is possible to see yoga as a sport in the Olympics in the future, it is not certain and may take some time. In the meantime, yoga continues to gain popularity and recognition as a holistic practice for physical and mental wellbeing.
